> ### 🧬 Perspective
The genetic information stored in our DNA must be accurately expressed, duplicated and maintained to allow cellular proliferation, differentiation and development to a multicellular organism. Eukaryotic DNA replication starts at multiple sites throughout the genome and is necessarily coordinated with other chromosomal processes including transcription, chromatin assembly and maturation, recombination and DNA repair. Notably, chromosomes provide the fundamental scaffold for all these dynamic and in part simultaneously occurring processes. 
- *How are these molecular activities coordinated on our genome?*
- *Can some of the complexes interfere with each other at certain regions of the genome?*


> ### 🎯 Goal
Our ultimate goal is to understand the genetic and epigenetic principles how these fundamental processes are regulated and coordinated to work together on the genome of eukaryotic cells.

> ### 🔬 Focus
We are particularly interested to identify the molecular players and characterize the sequence of events that allow DNA replication and transcription to occur simultaneously on our chromosomes - without major accidents leading to DNA damage and genome instability, a hallmark of cancer and many other human diseases. 

We use innovative microscopy and genomics approaches that sometimes require customized image analysis and high throughput sequencing data analysis pipelines that we want to share here with the community.
